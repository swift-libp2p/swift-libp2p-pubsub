> A WIP implementation of FloodSub and GossipSub Routers for swift-libp2p

> **Warning**
> This is a WIP. It probably won't work the way it's supposed to. Please file issues accordingly.

## Overview
This repo contains the pubsub implementation for swift-libp2p. We currently provide two message routers:

- Floodsub, which is the baseline flooding protocol.
- Gossipsub, which is a more advanced router with mesh formation and gossip propagation.

#### Note:
- For more information check out the [Libp2p PubSub Spec](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/pubsub) 

## Install

Include the following dependency in your Package.swift file
```Swift
let package = Package(
    ...
    dependencies: [
        ...
        .package(name: "LibP2PPubSub", url: "https://github.com/swift-libp2p/swift-libp2p-pubsub.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.0.1"))
    ],
    
    ...
)
```

## Usage

### Example 
check out the [tests]() for more examples

```Swift

import LibP2PPubSub

/// Configure libp2p
let app = Application(...)
// We have to use the `BasicConnectionLight` `Connection` implementation here! (the default `ARCConnection`, doesn't work due to the agressive timeout behaviour...)
app.connectionManager.use(connectionType: BasicConnectionLight.self)
// Tell it to use Floodsub
app.pubsub.use(.floodsub)
// Or tell it to use Gossipsub
app.pubsub.use(.gossipsub)

/// Subscribe
let subscription = try app.pubsub.gossipsub.subscribe(.init(topic: "news", signaturePolicy: .strictSign, validator: .acceptAll, messageIDFunc: .hashSequenceNumberAndFromFields))
subscription.on = { event -> EventLoopFuture<Void> in
    switch event {
    case .newPeer(let peer):
        ...
        
    case .data(let pubSubMessage):
        ...
        
    case .error(let error):
        ...
    }
    return app.eventLoopGroup.any().makeSucceededVoidFuture()
}


/// Publish Message
// Using a subscription
subscription.publish("Hello".data(using: .utf8))
// Without a subscription
app.pubsub.publish("Hello".data(using: .utf8), to: "topic")


/// Unsubscribe
// Using a subscription
subscription.unsubscribe()
// Without a subscription
app.pubsub.unsubscribe("topic")


/// Stop the app
app.shutdown()

```
